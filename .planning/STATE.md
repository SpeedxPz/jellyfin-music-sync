## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Setup: Use Electron 41 + electron-vite + TypeScript — all I/O in main process, renderer is display-only
- Setup: Use @jellyfin/sdk 0.13.0 (not deprecated jellyfin-apiclient)
- Setup: safeStorage for token persistence; need fallback strategy for headless Linux (open question)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `safeStorage` availability on headless Linux (no libsecret/kwallet) — fallback strategy needed before Phase 2
- Jellyfin API pagination: always use limit=500 + startIndex loop; default cap of 100 items will truncate large playlists

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:
